This code allows to generate an Arabic corpus based on keywords related to the subject of the study, cleaned and ready to use. 
The corpus will be stored in a json file in the same path as the ".py" is running. The output contains:
- Corpus Name
- Words count : total number of words and diffrent words
- Articles count: number of wikipedia articles returned into the corpus
- Articles: a dictionary containing all the textual data returned stored as { Article's title : Content}

  #1- import nltk
  #2- nltk.download('punkt')
- Python 2.7 or later
- Internet connection
- At least 20mb of free storage

2- Libraries used:
- Wikipedia: API for wiki articles, installation is required (pip install wikipedia or pip3 if it doesn't work)
- re.sub: function that alllow as to delete portions of text that are or not in the text

- request exception to handle connection errors and timeouts
- sleep for time out exeptions handling
- langdetect: a tool that detects languages, so that we don't return any article that is not written in arabic

3- How to use:
- Call the "BuildCorp" function with its two parameters:
